# Adaptative Gamification Api

An api for embed adaptative gamification mechanics (as well as common mechanics) in your web project. All data involved with the mechanics is managed through this application, so developers shouldn't care about managing gamification data, while they offer a gamified experience. This is a project from Barcelona University, namely NanoMOOC UB project, so for any use of it, contact with nanomoocsub@gmail.com

## Features ##

Currently the api generates incrustable code for the following gamification mechanics:

- Development Tools (Disruptor)
- Challenges (Disruptor)
- Easter Eggs (Free spirit)
- Unlockables (Free spirit)
- Badges (Achiever)
- Levels (Achiever)
- Points (Player)
- Leaderboards (Player)
- Lotteries (Player)
- Social Networks (Socializer)
- Social Statuses (Socializer)
- Sharing (Philantropist) :: TO DO
- Gifts (Philantropist) :: TO DO

## Installation ##

The api doesn't need any special installation: Just ensure that your virtualenv have installed all requirements (requirements.txt) or use the default venv in this repo (probably not working by dependences with the current development machine).

## Usage ##

Use django's runserver to run the application.
